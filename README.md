This is an umbrella repo, containing documentation all of the various components, firmware, and software, and their respective separate repos.

This is just the repo for storing the raw documentation files. Find the actual docs website at our [Read-the-Docs page](https://uniclogs-docs.readthedocs.io)!

Each repository is just a submodule, click on a git-submodule to follow it to its repo and it's own separate documentation, if you'd like to learn more about that particular submodule.

### OreFLAT0

A development version of OreSAT0 is integrated into the SatNOGS network by the name `OREFLAT-0`.

Several [provisional TLE's](./tles) have been provided to mock the satellite within the SatNOGS environment and provide necessary parameters for testing with Satnogs-in-the-loop.

***

## Miscellaneous Services

#### Mock Oresat

A mock of OreSat has been provided to stand in place of the actual satellite when integrating COSMOS tools into development.

**Start Mock-OreSat:**

`$` `python3 ./cosmos/mocks/oresat.py`

#### COSMOS Install

A docker image has been provided to make the development experience more seamless while allowing COSMOS to operate in the environment it needs. This docker image is based off the official [BallAerospace COSMOS Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ballaerospace/cosmos) but has been modified to include configurations and settings needed for UniClOGS.

**Install and run `ms-cosmos` from DockerHub:**

`$` `docker pull dmitrimcguuckin/ms-cosmos`

`$` `docker run --tty --interactive --detach --name cosmos --network=host --ipc=host --env DART_DB=$DART_DB --env DART_USERNAME=$COSI_USERNAME --env DART_PASSWORD=$COSI_PASSWORD --env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY --volume $XAUTH:/root/.Xauthority --volume /var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432:/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432 dmitrimcguuckin/ms-cosmos`

`$` `docker attach cosmos`

**Note:** *The variables beginning with DART are expected to exist by COSMOS, and can be provided either manually or they can be exported as environment variables in a `.bashrc` file. Either way, they are required in order to forward the details to the container and to COSMOS.*

#### PostgreSQL

Visit the [official PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) for instructions on how best to install on your system.
